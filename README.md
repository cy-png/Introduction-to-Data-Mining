[HW1-Clustering Package Design and Implementing](https://github.com/cy-png/Introduction-to-Data-Mining/tree/master/HW1-Clustering%20Package%20Design%20and%20Implementing)
- Discussion clustering as well as its application and adaption
- Caculate Entropy, Purity, F-measure, Silhouette Coefficient, Correlation, etc
- Write own python packages for cluster validity, including external measurements(accuracy, Normalized Mutual Information(NMI), Normalized Rand Index(NRI)) and internal measurements(Silhouette Index, Clustering Validation Index based on Nearest Neighbors (CVNN))
- Write own python packages for Lloyd’s K-Means and Hartigan’s K-means clustering with different initialization methods(such as Random initialization, K-Means++, Global K-means), run own packages with different datasets and validate with previous own validation packages.
- Write own python packages for DBSCAN clustering, run own algorithm on the anthill.csv dataset, and evaluate the performance in terms of the external measurements in bullet 3
